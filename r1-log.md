## Log

### Day 1: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt the basics of webscraping with Python requests library and BeautifulSoup4.

**Thoughts:** It is quite interesting to be able to download, parse websites for information in an automated manner, although I find it challenging about scraping markup that do not have a unique identifier such as an id or class in their markup.

## Day 2: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: made use of the pandas library and lernt about series, dataframe, performed opeartions on dataframe such as merging, cooncatention, joining, deleting and also reading csv and xlsl files with the pandas library.

**Thoughts:** I still have some issues understanding merging dataframes and also understanding multi-index level dataframe
