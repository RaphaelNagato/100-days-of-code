## Log

### Day 1: April 23, 20020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt the basics of webscraping with Python requests library and BeautifulSoup4.

**Thoughts:** It is quite interesting to be able to download, parse websites for information in an automated manner, although I find it challenging about scraping markup that do not have a unique identifier such as an id or class in their markup.

**Link to work:** [Webscraping script](https://github.com/RaphaelNagato/web_scraping_basics)
